-:scroll: To begin the assignment you may want to keep up the meeting slides or the flutter documentation since there's a lot of different parts to this weekly assignment.

-:coin: After getting your debugger/emulator setup you will want to create 3 stateless widgets, one to hold each of the 3 major screens that we will use in this weekly assignment. The first being the main page that we will use to navigate to the other 2. The 2nd and 3rd widgets will be a screen for the bottom navigation bar and the other one being for the navigation rail.
 
-:mailbox: Now before we get into each of the screens we will want to create the routes to each screen inside the MyApp class, inside the Material App specifically. In this widget you will want to write routes: {}, which will contain a route name, context to pass in, and a destination for each route (In this case it's the bottom navigation bar and navigation rail screen)

-:e-mail: In the Home Page you will want to create a row for 2 buttons, one that will navigate you to the screen with bottom navigation bar. In this textButton you will want a text saying "Go to bottom navigation bar" with an onPressed function that calls Navigator.pushNamed(conext, '/routeForBottomNavigationBar')

-:pen: For the textButton to navigate to the navigation rail you will want to do a similar thing except have a text saying "Go to navigation rail" with an onPressed function that calls Navigator.pushNamed(conext, '/routeForNavigationRail') (You don't actually have to name the route that but it's just to explain what it does)
